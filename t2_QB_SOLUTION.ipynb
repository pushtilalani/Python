Hospital has N rooms of two types – with TV and without TV, with daily rates of R1 and R2 respectively. However, from his experience Dr. Prasad knows that the number of patients is not constant throughout the year, instead it follows a pattern. The number of patients on any given day of the year is given by the following formula – (6-M)^2 + |D-15| , where M is the number of month (1 for jan, 2 for feb …12 for dec) and D is the date (1,2…31). All patients prefer without TV rooms as they are cheaper, but will opt for with TV rooms only if without TV rooms are not available. Hospital has a revenue target for the first year of operation. Given this target and the values of N, R1 and R2 you need to identify the number of TVs the hospital should buy so that it meets the revenue target.
